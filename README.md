# myshell
A basic shell written in C. Part of a course project.

## Compiling
To compile the program, just type `make` in your unix shell. 

## Usage
To run the shell in interactive mode, type `./wish`. A prompt like this should pop up: `wish>`. You can then give the shell any command that you have in your system PATH (`/bin`). You can see a list of these by typing `ls /bin`. 

A few common ones to try out:
- cat
- ls
- grep
